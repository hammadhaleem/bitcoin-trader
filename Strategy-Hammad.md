Rather than considering trades that would resultin sudden profit, it would be better to run a algorithm that is able to achieve an average profit.

Following conditions can help understand what I mean here. 

1. When Market is falling :  when market is falling we can buy more coins this will help us decrease our overall associated cost of total asserts.

2. When markets are rising : Issue trades of smaller denomination, going from current to a future predited value, such that on average we are able to recover associated cost of our asserts.

3. Arbitrage : At some moments, it can be observed that there is a price difference between exchanges on the bitcoin market, these difference are not ver frequent but do occur. We can constantly check for such occasions and execute trades on multiple platforms at a same time.

Also, each transaction in the bitcoin netwrok is confirmed byminers, smaller transactions are faster to get a confirmation for.
